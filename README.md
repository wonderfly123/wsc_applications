# Windansea Coconuts — Event Operations

Next.js application powering event operations for Windansea Coconuts. Hosted on Vercel at `windansea.vercel.app`.

## Applications

### 1. Banquet Event Order (BEO)

Internal event document that pulls data from ClickUp and renders a printable BEO.

- **URL:** `/beo/[taskId]`
- **Source:** Reads task custom fields from ClickUp API
- **Use:** Share with staff and vendors for event day logistics

### 2. Client Intake Automation

End-to-end intake flow triggered when a Pipedrive deal hits "Closed Won."

**Flow:**
1. Pipedrive automation sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/pipedrive`
2. ClickUp task is created in the Events list with deal data pre-populated (contact info, coconut qty, event date as start date, Pipedrive Deal ID/Title)
3. "Intake Form Complete" is set to "No"
4. Client receives a warm email from Harrison with a link to the intake form
5. Client fills out `/intake/[taskId]` — all fields, dropdowns, and file uploads (stamp logo, delivery map)
6. On submission, ClickUp task is updated with all form data, attachments are uploaded, and "Intake Form Complete" flips to "Yes"

**Intake Form Sections:**
- Client Information (name, email, phone, company)
- Event Package Details (type, headcount, package, garnish, coconut qty, setup)
- Event Location & Timing (service start/end, venue, load-in location)
- Additional Information (insurance, certifications, delivery instructions, notes)
- File Uploads (stamp logo, delivery map)
